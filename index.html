       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p>I am a motivated and avid learner pursuing a YearUp program in Quality Assurance at Seattle Central College. With 
        a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, I have demonstrated self-motivation 
        and a passion for coding through the development of personal projects. I am now seeking a software engineering internship
        to further enhance my technical skills, gain practical experience in an Agile development environment, and contribute to 
        impactful projects.</p>
       
       <p>
        I have a strong background in both business and technology, with a BA in Accounting and Finance and a growing expertise 
        in computer programming. My journey into tech has been rewarding and exciting, blending analytical skills from finance 
        with the logical, problem-solving approach of programming. As someone who enjoys challenging and interactive hobbies 
        like playing soccer and video games, I have found that these interests also fuel my curiosity and perseverance in the 
        tech world.</p>
           
      <p>Beyond my professional interests, I am a cat lover at heart, having shared my life with two beloved cats in the past. 
        Their companionship taught me patience, compassion, and joyâ€”qualities that extend into all areas of my life. In my free 
        time, you will find me enjoying the game of soccer, whether out on the field or as a fan. This combination of creativity, 
        dedication, and resilience makes me eager to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact in the tech field</p>
